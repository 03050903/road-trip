RoadTrip
========

(C) 2013 Romain Guy

RoadTrip is a sample application for Android that demonstrates how to implement several visual effects:

* Animated paths tracing
* Black & white to color conversion, used when scrolling a row of image to the left (the first image starts in B&W and turns into colors)
* Pinned scrolling, used to create a “stacked cards” effect when scrolling up and down the list
* Parallax scrolling, used to scroll the various maps at a different speed than other items
* Animated action bar opacity, as seen in Google Music
